 @GeneratedValue(generator = “auto_increment”)
 @GenericGenerator(name = “auto_increment”, strategy =
“increment”)
 @Column(name = “EXP_CD”)
 private Long EXP_CD; 
 
 We are using @ GenericGenerator and not the sequence generator in this case.
 Strategy type used is ‘increment’. 
 
 This generates Integer, long or short type of ids.


This generator reads maximum present primary key in database
table and then increments it by one and inserts new row with
new id.


Though the best id generators in Hibernate are enhancedtable
and enhanced-sequence, coupled with an appropriate
optimizer, such as hilo. For Instance, enhanced-table + hilo, inserts
over 10,000 records per second, but multiple insertion at this scale
is not a use case of application. So the data presented regarding
insertion is using Increment type generic generator
